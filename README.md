# improvinglogisticregression
Using a data set used for logisitic regression from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera, where a base accuracy of 89% is achieved, I try to improve the accuracy using learning curves and investigating if adding more features would help increase accuracy. 

Upon implementing a learning curve, it was observed that the learning curve suggests high bias within the predictive model, hence extra polynomial features were added to try and obtain better accuracy. This was done using another branch on the initial master, "Extra features".
